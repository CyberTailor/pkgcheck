# First cut at a pylintrc to match pkgcore's coding style.
#
# Use like "pylint --rcfile=dev-notes/pylintrc pkgcore".
#
# This is currently only tested with pylint 0.11.0. Generally using
# the latest ~arch pylint in portage is recommended.

# temporarily pass --disable-msg=id1,id2 (useful for things like
# docstrings (C0111)).
