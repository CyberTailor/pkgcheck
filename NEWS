pkgcore-checks Release Notes
=====================

See ChangeLog for full commit logs; this is summarized and major changes.

0.2.1:

* heavy refactoring of reporter subsystem, and clean up of check results.
  Better messages, better output for normal usage.  to_xml() methods were
  dropped (XmlReporter handles it on it's own), same for to_str() in favor
  of short_desc and long_desc attributes.
* whitespace checks now output one result for each classification for an
  ebuild, instead of emitting reports for each line.
* all remaining 'info' statements are pushed to stderr now.
* new PickleStream reporter; used to serialize check results, and flush the
  stream out stdout.  If you need to get at the data generated, this is the
  sanest way to do it (alternatives require trying to deserialize what a 
  reporter does, thus losing data).
* added new tool replay-pcheck-stream; used to replay a pickle stream through
  alternative reporters.

0.2:

* invocation args have changed- please see readme for details of how to
  use pcheck.
* test suite added; not yet complete coverage, but 90% of the way there.
* --list-checks output format is fair bit more human-readable now.
* better support for overlays (should work fine with appropriate commandline
  options supplied)
* optimizations, and performance regression fixes; fair bit faster then .1.
* new checks can be added via pkgcore 0.2 plugins cache.
* UI improvements; color, and human readable output.
* --xml option was dropped, use --reporter to specify the desired reporter,
  and --list-reporters to see what reporters are available
* added --enable, --disable options to prune add/remove specific checks from
  the run.
* add config based 'suites' that can be ran; basically, sets of tests/targets
  to run via pcheck.  See README for details.
* whitespace checks.
