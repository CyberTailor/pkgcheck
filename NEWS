pkgcore-checks Release Notes
=====================

See ChangeLog for full commit logs; this is summarized and major changes.

0.2:

* invocation args have changed- please see readme for details of how to
  use pcheck.
* test suite added; not yet complete coverage, but 90% of the way there.
* --list-checks output format is fair bit more human-readable now.
* better support for overlays (should work fine with appropriate commandline
  options supplied)
* optimizations, and performance regression fixes; fair bit faster then .1.
* new checks can be added via pkgcore 0.2 plugins cache.
* UI improvements; color, and human readable output.
* --xml option was dropped, use --reporter to specify the desired reporter,
  and --list-reporters to see what reporters are available
* added --enable, --disable options to prune add/remove specific checks from
  the run.
* add config based 'suites' that can be ran; basically, sets of tests/targets
  to run via pcheck.  See README for details.
* whitespace checks.

pkgcore-checks 0.1:
